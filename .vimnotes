#### Omnicompletion vs any completion ####
I've now realised that these are distinct things.
Omnicompletion is accessed through Ctrl+x, Ctrl+o,
whereas any completion is accessed through Ctrl+n. 

Any completion resembles pressing tab in sublime - it uses
keywords in the files you have open in any of the tabs
to find a match. 

Omni completion on the other hand tries to be smarter,
analysing the context in which you are using autocompletion,
for example whether you are inside of function that has yet to 
be closed with a closing bracket. 

Omni completion for R as implemented in the ncm-R plugin relies 
on a number of packages, including having an active Nvim-R session
open.

This isn't great as I'm not using Nvim-R. An alternative is to 
have a list of all R functions open in a buffer and to use any 
completion.


#### using e not w ####
e goes to the end of the current word, w goes to the start
of the next word. this is why my selections often go too far,
I've been pressing w not e.

#### vim surround ####
I realised that I had been using this wrong and that's
why it wasn't working properly before.

In visual selection mode:
S to trigger surround,
then the first bracket ( surrounds with extra whitespace
whilst the closing bracket ) surrounds with no whitespace

to surround a whole line: yss then the symbol of your choice
e.g. yss' will surround the whole line in single quotes

#### smart tab insertion ####
this setting means that tab inserts literal tab characters (or four spaces)
at the start of a string, but carries out omnicompletion in any other setting,
i.e. after a keyword
